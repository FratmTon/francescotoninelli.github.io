      <p>
        Francesco Toninelli is a sound maker and artist from Florence, Italy.
        Coming from a classical music background, he develops sound practices all-round: instrumental and electroacoustic composition, instruments creation, installations, text scores, music for dance and theatre, percussion instruments playing, sound engineering, pedagogy.
        His creations focus on the discovery and reinvention of the past and its representations, taking historiographical, archeological, literary and vernacular sources as starting points and resulting in diverse forms always bonded to the materiality of sound and the other elements.
